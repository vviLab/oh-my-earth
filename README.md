##Supported Desktop Environments

Tested
-----
* Unity 7
* Mate 1.8.1
* Pantheon
* LXDE
* OS X

## Configuration

You can configure the level of detail, by modifying the script. You can set the global variable `level` to `4`, `8`, `16`, or `20` to increase the quality (and thus the file size as well). Please keep in mind that it will also take more time to download the tiles.


### xfce4

On xfce4, you can set which displays you want to change the background of using the xfce displays variable. If you get an error and you're not sure which display to use, you can find your display in the output of:

    xfconf-query --channel xfce4-desktop --list | grep last-image

### Nitrogen

  If you use nitrogen for setting your wallpaper, you have to enter this in your `~/.config/nitrogen/bg-saved.cfg`.
